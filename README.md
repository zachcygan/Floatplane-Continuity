# Floatplane Continuity

## Description

The purpose of this project was to have videos on Floatplane.com continue where you left off watching them. I have wanted this feature for some time, but I know the devs are very busy and this is not their top priority. This application was built in a few hours and will be improved upon in the coming days. There are known bugs: When a video page is loaded and the user clicks on a video on the sidebar, the application WILL NOT work. I look to get this solved shortly. 

NOTE: This currently does not work on https://beta.floatplane.com

## Installation

The github repository is available at https://github.com/zachcygan/floatplane-continuity.

## Instructions

Download the github repo to your local machine. Then, in your Chrome address bar, type 'chrome://extensions/'. Enable 'Developer Mode' on the top right and then click 'Load unpacked' and select the downloaded github repo. Floatplane will then save the video progress of any video watched. 

To get best results with current extension build, click on videos from the floatplane.com homepage.
